Cleanup script for OSX

## Installation:

* Download the script file:
`curl -o cleanup https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehmetboraezer/mac-cleanup/master/cleanup.sh`

* Make it executable:
`chmod +x cleanup`

* Move to make it globally usable:
`sudo mv cleanup /usr/local/bin/cleanup`

##Â TODO:

* Calculate the difference of free space on the disk before and after cleanup
